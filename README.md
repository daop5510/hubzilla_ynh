## Hubzilla
[Hubzilla](https://zotlabs.org/page/hubzilla/hubzilla-project)is a social networking platform built with control of your privacy at center stage. Your online communications can be as public as you wish or as private as you require. Private conversations, private photos, private videos. Your media isn't hidden behind an obscure URL which can be guessed, it is protected by state-of-the-art cross-domain authentication. What this all means for you: less drama.

## Installation
Before installing, read the [Hubzilla installation instructions](https://framagit.org/hubzilla/core/blob/master/install/INSTALL.txt) for important information about


### Register a new domain and add it to YunoHost
- Hubzilla requires a dedicated domain, so obtain one and add it using the YunoHost admin panel. **Domains -> Add domain**. As Hubzilla uses the full domain and is installed on the root, you can create a subdomain such as hubzilla.domain.tld. Don't forget to update your DNS if you manage them manually.


#### YunoHost >= 2.5 :
Once the dedicated domain has been added to YunoHost, go again to the admin panel, go to domains then select your domain and click on "Install Let's Encrypt certificate".

### Install the Hubzilla application
Use the YunoHost admin panel to install Hubzilla by entering the GitHub repo address in the custom app URL

		https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/hubzilla_ynh

Make sure to your new domain created by the instruction in previous section as the application domain.

**For admin rights**: When installation is complete, you will need to visit your new hub's page and login with the **admin account username** which was entered at the time of installation process. You should then be able to create your first channel and have the admin rights for the hub.

**For normal YunoHost users:** Normal LDAP users can login through Ldap authentication and create there channels.

**If the admin cannot access the admin settings:** If the admin cannot access the admin settings at `https://hubzilla.example.com/admin` or you want to grant admin rights to any other user(s) on the hub, then you have to **manually add 4096** to the **account_roles** under **accounts** for that user in the **database through phpMYAdmin**.

**For logs:**: Go to **admin->logs** and enter the file name **php.log**. 

**Failed Database after Upgrade:** Some times databse upgrade fails after version upgrade. You can go to hub  eg. `https://hubzilla.example.com/admin/dbsync/` and upgrade it manually.
